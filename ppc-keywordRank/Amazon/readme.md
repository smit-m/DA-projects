This is a work in progress.

The script runs a keyword search and then scrapes (returns) the position of the ad along with the sponsor and more product details.
 - Caveats:
   - There are 2 different layouts: list and default (currently script can take care of both)
   - There are different ads: banner, product page, list, etc (WIP)
